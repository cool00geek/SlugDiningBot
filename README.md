# Dining Hall Scraper

A Simple webscraper to get the UCSC dining hall menus

Also has a Telegram bot!

To run the bot, set an environment variable: `TELEGRAM_UCSC_KEY` containing the key and run `bot.py`

To run the command line app, run `UCSCDining.py`

You can interact with my telegram bot at [t.me/UCSCDining_bot](t.me/UCSCDining_bot) when the server is running
